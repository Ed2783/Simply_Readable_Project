The Pii StepFunction job is created by the Main StepFunction. Whilst it is processing the Main StepFunction is paused and waits for a callback. This callback token is stored within the DB.

When Macie completes the detection job it will publish a log. This log is used to trigger a Lambda function to parse the log and start the Callback StepFunction. The responsibility of the Lambda function is to determine the job id that relates to this detection job.
