Before using the Amazon Bedrock service we must first gain access to the appropriate models. This can be done via the Amazon Bedrock console for the chosen region. Which models you choose is down to you. 

Please review [Amazon Bedrock]({{< ref "docs/readable/architecture/bedrock" >}}) for models supported by this app.

Please follow the [Amazon Bedrock documentation for Model Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) to enable the models in your AWS Account.
