This app is created with a modular architecture to enable the growth of future capabilities and managability of the code. There are shared features and non-shared features. Shared features are deployed for all configurations whilst non-shared features are only deployed when those features are enabled. 

This documentation is split with that in mind. This page will cover a high level overview of how these modules are interconnected, leaving module specific details to their respective pages in this documentation.
