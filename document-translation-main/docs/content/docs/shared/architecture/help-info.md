This is a simple feature to provide "Help Information" to your end users. The Web UI has this built in and the data can be called into other clients you wish to use. This feature is required. 

Help Information is data provided from an AWS DynamoDB table and presented in the Web UI. The data provided is customisable by your organisation to best suit your use case and users.
